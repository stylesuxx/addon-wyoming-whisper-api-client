# Home Assistant Add-On Repository
Since the [Home Assistant Community Add-On Repository](https://github.com/hassio-addons/repository) is *"...currently not accepting third party add-ons.."*, I am running my own repository. This repository contains add-ons that I have created and use personally.

## Add-ons
The following add-ons are available in this repository:

- [Wyoming Whisper API Client](https://github.com/chris-projects/home-assistant-add-ons/tree/master/wyoming_whisper_api_client) - Interact with a whisper.cpp server instance that is not running on the same host as Home Assistant.

## Contributing
Contributions are very welcome! If you have any ideas for new add-ons or improvements to existing ones, feel free to open a pull request.

If you have an idea for a new add-on, feel free to open an issue and I will do my best to implement it.
